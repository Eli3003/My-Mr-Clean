## Task
We have some troubles with data in our company and solving will take near a week, so I should solve the problem by my own hands. I must parse article from Wikipedia API about "Ozone layer". From this article I should take most common words and vizualize it.

## Description
I used requests to parse article from API, after i used regex to clean data and used seaborn for vizualize. I googled some parts to find some information about parsing with json format in requests.

## Installation
You should just run my code on Jupyter

## Usage
Every function working properly
